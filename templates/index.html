												<p>Cyber-insurance is a kind of mechanism to manage cyber-risk and is increasingly popular in the industrial field. It can help cover risks resulted from a cyber-attack for industrial companies or organizations. It has been shown by a significant number of studies that it assists in the improvements in cyber-security. When a very large-scale cyber-attack happens to a product composed of several different parts, which are manufactured by several different companies, it is likely that the scale of the attack is so large that a single insurance provider of the victim organization is not able to cover the multi-party loss. Therefore, they have to re-insure itself via other cyber-insurance firms. Since most cyber-insurance companies are very risk-averse and profit minded at the same time, they are very unwilling to open new market segment for catastrophic cyber-events if they do not have enough information about exactly how much risks are there in these events. Hence, the job of likelihood estimation of cyber-risk is of great importance. If we do not solve this problem, it is likely that cyber-insurance markets will break down, which will negatively impact a large number of companies and the society in general and can cause economic recession. Our main goal is to first investigate how different network topologies affect the spread of liability attack, and then design a policy for cyber-insurance market to handle future cyber-attacks based on statistical cyber-risk distribution.</p>

												<p>We divide the process of cyber-attacks into 3 processes, and we analyze them one by one. The first process is infection stochastic process. Hackers usually let the virus spread in the network for a period of time before attacking to make sure that it infects as many computers as possible. In this process, the virus doesn’t do anything other than infection, so the infected computers usually don’t know that they are infected. The second process is attack stochastic process. This is a counting process. Once the maximum number of infections has been reached, the attack happens very quickly. The third process is loss stochastic process. The loss for losing different smart device is different; the loss for the same device at different time is difference; and the loss for difference levels of attack is also different. Given a loss function, we can calculate the total loss of a cyber-attack. I am going to help solve the problem by creating a software that can help insurance companies intuitively understand the cyber risk of a given network topology and how much improvements we can make by applying different engineering methods, so that they can device insurance products based on these results. For the simulation of propagation of virus through the networks, I tried several different infection models, including SIS, SIRS, SEIR, SIR, where ‘S’ stands for susceptible; ‘I’ stands for infected; ‘R’ stands for recovered; and ‘E’ stands for exposed. Susceptible means that the node has not yet been infected but can be infected. Recovered means the node had been infected and had recovered from it and can never be infected again. And exposed means that the node is infected but is not yet infectious. I discovered that as long as there exist a ‘recovered’ stage in the model, the number of infected nodes always converges to 0, no matter what the initial conditions are. This kind of result is not desired because it doesn’t conform with reality and is useless in the context of cyber-attack. Therefore, I choose to use the ‘SIS’ and ‘SIRS’ models. </p>

												<p>At the end of the semester, I am going to deliver a software that can simulate the whole process of cyber-attacks. First, users can specify the topology and some key parameters of a network configuration. The topologies can be ring, star, cluster, homogeneous, random graph and so on. and the parameters include the order of the graph, the probability of having an edge (for random graph), and the mean and variance of the degrees of vertices (for homogeneous graph). After users press the simulation button, an animation of the network demonstrating how virus propagates will show along with six plots dynamically showing some key indicators of the network. These indicators include but not limited to the proportion of infected nodes (time series), frequency density of number of infected nodes (PDF), log-return of the time series, auto correlation function of squared value of log-return, Q-Q plot of the PDF vs. normal distribution and Q-Q plot of the log-return vs. normal distribution. From these plots, users can have an intuitive idea about how the given network configuration is resistive to cyber-attacks. Additionally, users can modify the topology of the network by applying different engineering methods. These methods include but not limited to minimal spanning tree, edge cover, exact cover and so on. After the application of these engineering methods, there will be more lines appearing on the six plots mentioned above. From these lines, user can directly see the difference in cyber-risk between the original and modified network topology.  This is the first stage of the project, which simulates the infection stochastic process. In the second stage, I will integrate the function of simulating attacks. And in the third stage, simulation of loss process will be added. By then, the software will be able to simulate the whole process of a cyber-attack.

                        <p> ln-app advertising is an essential part of the current digital ecosystem driven by free mobile applications, where the ecosystem entities comprise the consumer apps, their clients (consumers), ad-networks, advertisers, and retailers. Sensitive consumer information is often being sold downstream in this ecosystem without the knowledge of consumers, and in many cases to their annoyance. As a popular example, the gene testing company 23andMe might sell their clientele information directly to pharmaceutical companies for the latter to develop medical drugs. While this may result in long-term benefits for the consumers, it can result in serious short-term information privacy breaches of very significant personal consumer health data. The question we raise is: Is it economically feasible to trade consumer information with their permission (specially in the wake of GDPR) and in return provide them incentives (monetary or otherwise) in a manner so as to ensure optimal social welfare satisfying all ecosystem entities?. The incentive/reward for the willful consent taking the shape of monetary compensation (e.g., discounts, Facebook Libre Coins), intangible benefits (e.g., personalization and customization of information content), and service price discrimination. The practical significance of this question lies in the fact that an inability to trade (with incentives) such information would be commercially unfair to the consumers in this surveillance age; on the other hand trading inappropriately might open up privacy issues - thus the societal need to maintain a balance between the two. To this end, we are interested in the following two important questions: (a) how to design social experiments to judge the willingness (and derive additional social insights) of consumers in the first place to trade personal information in return for incentives?, and (b) how can we engineer consensual privacy trading mechanisms so as to mathematically ensure a win-win trade agreement among the data sellers and buyers is indeed beneficial from a social welfare angle. i.e., commercially satisfies the sellers, at the same time appropriately preserves consumer privacy. The overall impact of this research would pave the way in future of how personal information should be traded efficienty in the surveillance era.</p>

I was deeply impressed by the motto of Shuping, which is that since you have received so much from the society, you need to give back to it. When I graduated from my high school, I joined the IT group of Sho Bing Scholars Association, and started beeing a volunteer for it. Our job was to develop a brand new scholarship application system from scratch using InfoPath IDE. During the development, a member droped the group, so I took his job. In the end, I did almost 70% of the technical job, and I keep maintaining it and adding new funtions to it every year.</p>
